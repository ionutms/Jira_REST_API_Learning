    "#### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jira is a project management and issue tracking tool\n",
    "- Jira is folowing the \"**Agile**\", which is a software developement methodology to help teamns get more stuff done by self-organizing their work\n",
    "- In Jira we have an **Agile board** which is composed of at least **3 columns**:\n",
    "  - *TO DO*\n",
    "  - *IN PROGRESS*\n",
    "  - *DONE*\n",
    "- There are two primary **ways to organize\"** a project:\n",
    "  - *Scrum*\n",
    "  - *Kanban*\n",
    "- The difference is that the *Scrum* has **Sprints**\n",
    "- A sprint is a pre-determinated amount of time where teams determinate the work to get done\n",
    "- Durring a sprint, the decided TO DO items from the previous sprint are solved one by one\n",
    "- In a Kanban workflow, new TO DO items may appear at any given time\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other agile terms are:\n",
    "  - **Story**\n",
    "    - (As a *some type of user*, I want *something* because of *some reason*)\n",
    "  - **Epic**\n",
    "    - multipe Story compose an Epic\n",
    "  - **Issues**\n",
    "    - the task it-self, which can have different types icluding stories, epics, or bugs or something custom\n",
    "  - **Projects**\n",
    "    - multiple issues can be organized in a project"
